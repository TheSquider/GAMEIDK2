#Do basic Menu (done)
#Do NPC move (done)
#FIX NPC MOVE
    -Get rid of repitition (done-no player merger)
    -Generalise (done)
    -Stop moving while talking (impossible right now) (did it)
    -Infinite move (uneeded, 1 hour should be enough (the ms hit is big though))
    !-Sometimes NPCs clip through walls and idk why (not an issue, rare)
#Do paths (done-for now)
#Do NPC dialog choice (THEY CAN FUCKING RUN CODE LESSS GOOOO) (Can work with menu) (Is tied with menu)
#Do NPC dialog seporate from npc.js (How am I going to get a filesystem working without Node.js?)
#FIX CLASSES (Will do later)
#Generalise Menu (done-but now I HAVE to make a seporate file for menu interactions)
#Do items
#Do quests

Rooted class names (basic.js, ln: 131 & 147-152)
